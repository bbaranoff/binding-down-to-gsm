## Installation

### Install required tools

Python3 must be installed on your system. Check the current Python version
with the following command

```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

Depending on which command `Python 3.x.y` (with x.y as some numbers) is
returned, use that command to proceed.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
